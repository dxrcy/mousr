## Controls

Shortcuts are only work when the program is active (when tray icon is green), except for `Alt+Insert` (`MISC.ACTIVATE`)

Default controls, listed with config names:

- `F5` spins the cursor in a circle (to test if it is functioning). `MISC.SPIN`
- `Alt+Insert` activates and deactivates the program. `MISC.ACTIVATE`
- - `Shift+Alt+Insert` kills the program. `MISC.KILL`

- `IJKL` moves the cursor (Up, Left, Down, Right). `MOUSE.LEFT`, `MOUSE.UP`, ect.
- - Holding `Shift` slows the speed. `MOUSE_SLOW.LEFT`, `MOUSE_SLOW.UP`, ect.
 
- `U`, `8`, `O` map to the Left, Middle (scroll), and Right clicks respectively. `CLICK.LEFT`, `CLICK.MIDDLE`, `CLICK.RIGHT`, `CLICK.HOLD`

- `WASD` scrolls (Up, Left, Down, Right). `SCROLL.LEFT`, `SCROLL.UP`, ect.

- `V`, `B` increase or decrease speed of cursor. `SPEED.DOWN`, `SPEED.UP`
- - Holding `Shift` sets speed to minimum or maximum. `SPEED.MIN`, `SPEED.MAX`
- `G` resets speed `SPEED.RESET`

### Changing controls

To change hotkeys or settings, **make sure Mousr not running**, and edit `config.ini` in the app directory, then restart Mousr.
